Usage
The README page consists of a container element that is styled with CSS grid. The grid areas are defined for the header, sidebar, content, and footer sections of the page. The grid is set to repeat 4 columns and has a grid gap of 15px. The container has a black border with a background color of green. The font size is set to 1rem, and the container's height is set to max-content with a max-width of 1200px.

The media query is used to adjust the grid layout and font size when the screen size is smaller than 768px. The grid areas are updated, the font size is reduced, and the border width and grid gap are adjusted accordingly.
